      Personas and Storyboarding
    </h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to examine an interface and three users to step into their shoes and 
      understand their experiences. I then created two personas and a storyboard based on my findings. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="header">
      Interface: 
    </h2>

    <div class = "interface_contain">
      <img class = "image" src = "lamp.png" alt = "Layout of lamp interface." height = "500"/>
      <p>
        This interface is a lamp that provides light and several customizable features. The base of the lamp offers 
        (on the top row of buttons starting from the left): power, light modes, (on the bottom row of buttons starting 
        from the left): dimmer light, a 1 hour timer, a 2 hour timer, brighter light, (on the back of the base): 
        USB portals for charging another device. These buttons are flat on the base of the lamp and light up when 
        the lamp is on. The lamp is adjustable at two joints: one where the body connects to the base, and one where 
        the light connects to the body.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="header">
      Users: These are the three users that I examined and interviewed. 
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        User 1: A college student who commonly uses this lamp several times a week to do homework.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 2: A biochemist who has never used the lamp before.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 3: A college student who has seen the lamp before and has used it once or twice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header">
      Observations: I made detailed, objective observations of each user's interaction with the lamp.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>User 1: User 1 already has a light on before (and while) using the lamp. After sitting down 
        at the desk, User 1 immediately presses the power button after looking down at the button panel. 
        Unlike other users, he does not make any adjustments to the position of the lamp or touch any of 
        the other buttons other than the power button. After using the lamp to do schoolwork, User 1 
        looks down at the button panel and presses the power button. 
      </li>
      <li>User 2: Like User 1, User 2 already has a light on before (and while) using the lamp. After sitting 
        down at the desk, User 2 looks at the button panel for a few seconds before selecting the power button. 
        User 2 presses the brighter light button several times before pressing the dimmer light button, bringing
        the intensity of the light to a few settings higher than it originally was. User 2 then takes a few 
        seconds to look at the buttons again before pressing the mode button once. After seeing the change in 
        lighting mode, User 2 presses the mode button several times in quick succession, shifting through all 
        the modes around 4 times until stopping at the original mode. 
      </li>
      <li>
        User 3: Unlike Users 1 and 2, User 3 does not have any lights on before using the lamp. After walking over 
        to the desk, User 3 leans down extremely close to the lamp base and presses the power button. User 3 then 
        adjusts the lamp light’s angle by moving the top joint. After User 3 spends a short amount of time looking 
        at her laptop, she presses the 1H timer, then the 2H timer, then the 1H timer again. User 3 then presses 
        the mode button several times, but much slower and fewer times when compared to User 2, and leaves the light
        on the warm mode. User 3 works on her laptop until the timer runs out.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">
      Interview: After observing the users, I asked a few questions about their experiences.

      User 1:
    </h4>
    <p>
      User 1 uses the lamp at night to do homework on paper (around three times a week). User 1 would rate this lamp 
      at an 8. He doesn’t use any buttons other than the power button and thinks that the lamp could have more feature
      than it currently does. User 1 likes that there is no sound when any of the buttons are pressed and thinks that 
      the lamp responds quickly when buttons are pressed (when compared to other lamps, which usually make a sound when 
      they’re turned on and may take more time to react). He likes the layout of the lamp because the two main buttons 
      (power and mode) are placed above the other buttons. When using the lamp, User 1 feels annoyed and unexcited 
      because he needs to do homework. 
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      When User 1 first used the lamp, he played around with the settings until he was satisfied with the results. 
      He also had to adjust settings often because it was placed in a common study room and others would change the 
      settings. User 1 found it bothersome to have to constantly adjust the lamp settings because other people used 
      it as well. Now, he only uses the power button because he brought the lamp home and his preferred settings from 
      the last time he used the lamp remain unchanged. Prior to using this lamp this semester at home, User 1 did not
      have a lamp in his room. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="header">
      User 2:
    </h4>
    <p>
      User 2 thinks he would use the lamp when it is dark outside to do work on his computer so he can see clearly. He would 
      rate this lamp at an 8 or 9 because it is simple to use (he thinks that the power button, timer buttons, and intensity
      adjustment buttons have easily recognizable symbols). User 2 likes the layout of the buttons because it looks nice and
      the main buttons are placed above the other functions. Before using the lamp, User 2 has the impression that the lamp 
      is modern and fancy. He also thinks it would be quite expensive. While using the lamp, User 2 has the impression that 
      the lamp responds well to simple touch. Because he would use the lamp to do work, User 2 thinks he would feel reluctant 
      and tired when using the lamp.

    <p>
      User 2 thinks the lamp has an on/off function, a function to change the color of the light, two functions to set
      timers, and a function to change the brightness of the light.
    </p>

    <h4 class="header">
      User 3:
    </h4>
    <p>
      User 3 thinks she would use this lamp in the common study area to do homework when it is dark. User 3 would 
      rate this lamp at a 8 or 9 because the design looks nice and the lamp can be adjusted in a variety of ways. 
      User 3 thinks that the timer function isn’t very obvious but likes the simple, straightforward symbols like 
      the power, mode, and brightness adjustment. User 3 thinks the lamp controls respond to light touch well, but 
      is worried that the buttons might break or malfunction in the future if she presses them too roughly. User 3 
      likes the balanced layout of the buttons but thinks that the buttons should not light up when the lamp is on 
      because it makes it hard to see the symbols and the lights don’t give much information (other than the lights 
      behind the timer buttons that indicate activation of a timer). User 3 feels excited when using the lamp 
      because she thinks it looks very technological, which she likes.

      Followup Answers
    </h5>
    <p>
      User 3 wanted to see what all the buttons did because she was unfamiliar with them and switched through the
      modes several times to make sure she didn’t miss any of the modes. User 3 would likely use the warm mode light 
      because it’s easier on the eyes at night. User 3 thinks she would potentially use the timer to time her 
      studying or before she goes to sleep in her bed, but she thinks it would be a little impractical.

      Personas: I created two personas based on the 3 users I interviewed. 
    </h3>

    <h4 class="header">
      Persona 1
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Tired Tim is a father of two who works at a pharmaceutical company. He always checks up on his experiments 
        and works at home; he spends most of his time sitting in front of the computer at night. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Tired Tim thinks that the lamp has too many functionalities and that the buttons can be hard to see when it is
        dark or when the lights obscure the symbol. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Tired Tim represents the lifestyle and personality of User 2 but also the habits of User 1. Tired Tim is a frequent
        user of the lamp who is mostly satisfied with its functionality.

      </li>
      <li>
        Excited Emma thinks that it is too inconvenient to have to switch lighting modes whenever she uses the lamp 
        and thinks doesn't like that the timer and the mode buttons are not intuitive.

      <li>
        Excited Emma represents the opinions and habits of User 3 and the lifestyle of User 1. Excited Emma is an infrequent
